# Discord Banner Rotation #

Also called Chocomint Pie because it's in Python and this is a clone of a bot called Chocomint with similar functionality.

Usage:
 - Install Python 3.7.x (idk about later versions)
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Copy `config.sample.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill out details
 - Fill specified banners folder with banners (cropped to size)
 - Run `main.py`

Run the reload command to reload all banners based on what's in the file. This will not repeat completed banners but will remove any that are no longer in the files.

Users can say "what banner is this?" or similar to bring up stats on the banners.
